<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Mitudru Dutta from a small town of Dhupguri. I am living with my parents and my pet dog. I am learning Web development and this is my first website that will keep me going.</p>

<p>I have completed my senior secondary from Army Public School, Binnaguri and my secondary exam from Techno India Group Public School, Falakata</p>

<p>I am having short of words to put in my about me section. I wanted to do lorem ipsum but as this is my first website I wanted to give something personal into it and there we go.</p>
